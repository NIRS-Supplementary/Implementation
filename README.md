# Implementation of data-aware soundness verification algorithm

This toolkit allows to verify data-aware soundness of DPNs using two implementations that differ in a way how quantifier elimination is implemented.

### Prerequisities:
- Windows 10/11
- .NET Desktop runtime 6.0

### Installation:
No installation needed. The application is portable.

### Running:
To run the app, open DataPetriNetOnSmt.Visualization.exe.

The process models are imported in the extended PNML-format. See Input_Model_Example.pnmlx as an example. 
Currently, the supported variable types include:
- Integer,
- Boolean,
- Real.
